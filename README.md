# AI Generated Report Detector

This project detects if a report text is generated by AI or written by a human. It uses natural language processing and named entity recognition to analyze the text.
# How it Works

   ## Uses spaCy for NER with the en_core_web_sm model
   ## Focuses on detecting "ORG" named entities which are more prevalent in AI text
   ## Classifies report as AI generated if "ORG" entities are found, else considers it human written

# Usage

Run python detector.py and input/upload text for analysis.
# Requirements

   ## Python
   ## spaCy
   ## Tkinter

#Limitations

   ## Accuracy decreases for advanced AI generation methods
   ## Works best for English text
   ## PDF extraction can be unreliable
